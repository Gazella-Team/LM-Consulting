In most cases, it comes down to the growth stage of your SaaS. Larger organizations and enterprises mostly have special needs for features, advanced systems and extra functionalities, while smaller startups prefer to have only the essential features from each tool, with simple onboardings and low pricing. When building new SaaS projects, there are 2 common tools to setup and manage in order to maximise product value and overview:

-   **Web Analytics**
-   **User Feedback**


## Pros of using a collective toolbox

-   **Better overview**: By having one collective toolbox to manage the essential tools for your SaaS, you achieve a larger overview, as you switch from managing multiple subscriptions across different platforms, to controlling everything from one place.
-   **No bloated tools**: Collective toolboxes focus on offering only the essential features of each tool, to simplify onboardings, and maximise value.

## Cons of using a collective toolbox

-   **Limited features**: As your SaaS grows, your needs for specific tool-features follow, and most "all-in-one" toolboxes only offer the most essential features from each tool, limiting the possibilities of what you can use them for.
