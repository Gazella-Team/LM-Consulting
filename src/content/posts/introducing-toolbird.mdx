It all started, with us spotting a common issue in the SaaS community:

When building and scaling SaaS startups, various tools as web analytics, uptime monitoring and user feedback are essential for a clear project overview. Managing multiple subscriptions across different providers can be costly, averaging $69.34/month, and lead to poor overview. Toolbird offers the solution, by providing web analytcis, user feedback and uptime monitoring in one collective place, with only a 5 minutte setup.



## Two teens, one startup
The founding partners behind Toolbird are 18 year old Simon Maribo, and 17 year old Lasse Osmann.
