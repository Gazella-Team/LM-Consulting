It all started, with us spotting a common issue in the SaaS community:

When building and scaling SaaS startups, various tools as web analytics, uptime monitoring and user feedback are essential for a clear project overview. Managing multiple subscriptions across different providers can be costly, averaging $69.34/month, and lead to poor overview. Toolbird offers the solution, by providing web analytcis, user feedback and uptime monitoring in one collective place, with only a 5 minutte setup.

Many SaaS-related tools tend to have advanced onboardings and setups, just to get the minimal essential flow of the tool to run, by supplying lots of catchy features that you don't use in the startup phase. **We believe it's a waste of time**. Toolbird strives after simplicity, ensuring that you can have each tool up and running within a few minutes.

With all these values combined, you achieve many advantages with Toolbird:

-   Better overview, as all your tools are collected in one place, with one subscription.
-   Less costs, as we only price on what you use, with a flat monthly fee.
-   Time saving, as our onboarding takes 5 minutes or less.

## What you can do with Toolbird so far

Our first beta-version for test users were live for the first time on May 12, 2024. This version includes the following tools and features ready to use:

-   Web analytics tool, with analysis of refferals, pages, locations and devices.
-   Supplementary waitlist tool to collect signups for new launches.
-   Team collaboration, to work as effectively as possible.

## What is next for Toolbird?

Over the coming months from now, there are several tools and features in the line:

-   Demo launch of uptime monitoring tool
-   Demo launch of user feedback tool
-   Custom event tracking (web analytics)

## Journey of a teenage startup

## Where we see ourselves in 5 years

Think of the various tasks you perform on routine when starting to build a new digital platform / SaaS. You usually create a repository on GitHub to develop it, you create social accounts to promote it and you create a startup on Product Hunt to gain traction. Our long-term vision for Toolbird is very similar:

> We aim to become the “go-to” tool-provider for solo developers and tech startups when building new products.

As listed with the routine tasks mentioned above, we aim to make it standard for SaaS startups to sign up for Toolbird to manage their project, when starting to build something new. This is why, we've made our product as startup-friendly as possible.
